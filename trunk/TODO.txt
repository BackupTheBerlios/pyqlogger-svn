This is a list of stuff that we'd like to do at some point:
* Support for multiple accounts with different blog providers
* Allow enabling/disabling plugins
* Progress bar when uploading a picture (consider rewriting all the code in async Qt)
* Complete options dialog 
* Options for each plugin separatly
* Allow plugins to store settings in main config file
* Write plugin to auto substitute keywords with preconfigured values
* Unified error/warning/info reporting mechanism, not just for Blogger status messages
* Rename variables such as a0 and pp to more obvious ones
* Make setpreview more efficient - it's updated on every key stroke, rather than 
  only when the preview is being shown. This could be done using the tab widget's 
  signal handlers (done)
* Better command line argument handling (done. should be refined in kde)

* Proposed data schema for multiple accounts/blogs

     Account                Blog
  
  The Application can hold multiple Account objects which in turn can own 
  multiple Blog objects. The Blog objects themselves should be able to 
  provide the application with an interface like:
  Post()
  fetchPosts()
  Update()
  getTitle()
  getBody()
  ..
  
  Accounts should have an interface that can do things like:
  Login()
  FetchBlogs()
  ..
  
  The Application itself should hold the information regarding the current
  selected blog. 

  That's about all I can come up with at 6:15AM. I need to make my lunch.
