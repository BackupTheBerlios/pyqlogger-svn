This is a list of stuff that we'd like to do at some point:
* Support for multiple accounts with different blog providers
* Allow enabling/disabling plugins
* Progress bar when uploading a picture
* Complete options dialog 
* Options for each plugin separatly
* Allow plugins to store settings in main config file
* Write plugin to auto substitute keywords with preconfigured values
* Unified error/warning/info reporting mechanism, not just for Blogger status messages
* Rename variables such as a0 and pp to more obvious ones
